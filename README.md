# This repository was built using the same code from tunapanda https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone/tree/1.3.x. I've made modifications to help others download this code and add it to their repository so they can self-host H5P using GitHub pages.


# This repository was built from LanceRoe h5p host example. https://github.com/LanceRoe/h5p-selfhost-example I modified the processs to directly host direct html files exported from H5P created in LUMI. No need to add contents in 'Demo' folder as the workspace folder would be directly referenced in the index.
